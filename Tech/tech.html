			<p class="lead"> That's enough storage space to install every game on Steam over 6,000 times. </p>
			<p class="lead"> Researchers in Japan say they've concocted a new method of creating wafers out of diamonds able to store mammoth amounts of data on them.<br>
			We're talking 25 exabytes of storage, which is a 25,000 petabytes. Or 25,000,000 terabytes. Or 25 billion gigabytes. It's a dizzying amount of data, that's for sure. <br>
            If you assume there's roughly 50,000 games on Steam and each one is around 80GB, which to be completely honest is probably a gross exaggeration of the average game install size on the platform,<br>
			you'd be looking at around four petabytes of data required to install the lot. So with a single diamond wafer you could save the entire Steam catalogue 6,250 times. <br> 
            Though there's likely room for much more if you factor in how many visual novels there are on Steam. <br>
            Now it's not like this diamond wafer will act like a disc you throw into your machine. This is quantum storage, and it uses a defect in diamond, known as the nitrogen-vacancy center, to store a quantum bit, or qubit (via New Atlas). <br>
            This defect in diamonds has proven quite useful already in use for quantum computers, as it allows researchers to read out the specific spin of an electron. That's a key part of how a quantum computer works, along with quantum entanglement, <br>
			and how they might one day reach a point of utility for computing workloads far beyond what is possible with a classical computer today. These diamond qubits are even useful at room temperature, <br>
			which means less reliance on super-cooling gases that many quantum qubits require to operate. </p>
